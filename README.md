## Compilation and Running Instructions

### Compilation
To compile the project, open a terminal in the project root directory and run:

```bash
javac -cp .:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar -d bin src/*.java test/*.java
```

### Running Tests
To run all JUnit tests:

```bash
java -cp bin:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore DatabaseTest DatabaseDataTest ItemTest MessageTest PaymentProcessorTest TransactionTest TransactionResultTest UserTest
```

To run a specific test class (ex. UserTest):

```bash
java -cp bin:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore UserTest
```

## Class Descriptions

### User
**Functionality:**
- Represents a user in the system with username, password, and balance
- Provides methods to get username, check password, get/set balance
- All users start with an initial, arbitrary balance of 100.0

**Testing:**
- Verified username retrieval functionality
- Confirmed that password validation works correctly for both correct and incorrect passwords
- Validated that initial balance is set to 100.0
- Tested balance modification including setting to positive, zero, and negative values

**Relationships:**
- Referenced by Database for user management
- Used by PaymentProcessor to handle transactions

### Item
**Functionality:**
- Represents an item in the marketplace with id, title, description, price, seller, and sold status
- Items are created with unsold status by default
- Provides methods to access all properties

**Testing:**
- Verified all getters and setters
- Confirmed default sold status is false
- Tested sold status modification
- Validated all item properties are stored and retrieved correctly

**Relationships:**
- Stored and managed by Database
- Used in Transaction to represent purchased items
- Referenced in Message for item-related messaging

### Message
**Functionality:**
- Represents communication between users about specific items
- Contains sender, recipient, content, timestamp, and associated item ID
- Timestamps are automatically generated upon message creation

**Testing:**
- Verified all message properties are stored and retrieved correctly
- Confirmed timestamp is generated appropriately
- Tested retrieval of sender, recipient, content, and associated item ID

**Relationships:**
- Stored and managed by Database
- Links users to items through communications

### Transaction
**Functionality:**
- Represents a financial transaction between a buyer and seller for a specific item
- Contains buyer, seller, item ID, amount, and timestamp
- Timestamps are automatically generated upon transaction creation

**Testing:**
- Verified all transaction properties are stored correctly
- Confirmed timestamp generation is appropriate
- Validated buyer, seller, item ID, and amount information

**Relationships:**
- Generated by PaymentProcessor
- Stored by Database
- Connects buyers and sellers to items

### TransactionResult
**Functionality:**
- Represents the outcome of a payment processing attempt
- Contains success status, message, and optionally an item ID
- Provides feedback on why a transaction succeeded or failed

**Testing:**
- Tested success and failure states
- Confirmed appropriate messages are stored
- Verified item ID handling for both provided and default cases

**Relationships:**
- Returned by PaymentProcessor to indicate transaction results

### PaymentProcessor
**Functionality:**
- Manages payment transactions between users
- Verifies sufficient funds before processing
- Updates user balances and marks items as sold
- Records transaction history

**Testing:**
- Tested sufficient funds verification for various scenarios
- Confirmed successful payment processing with balance updates
- Verified error handling for all potential failure cases
- Tested transaction history recording and retrieval

**Relationships:**
- Uses Database to access and modify user and item data
- Creates and manages Transaction objects
- Returns TransactionResult objects

### Database
**Functionality:**
- Central data store for the entire marketplace system
- Manages users, items, messages, and transactions
- Provides methods to search, add, update, and remove data

**Testing:**
- Verified user management (add, retrieve, remove)
- Confirmed item management (add, retrieve, remove, search)
- Tested message storage and retrieval
- Validated transaction recording and retrieval
- Confirmed data persistence through save/load operations

**Relationships:**
- Core component that interfaces with all other classes
- Used by PaymentProcessor for data access and modification

### DatabaseData
**Functionality:**
- Container class for serializable data
- Holds collections of users, items, messages, and transactions
- Maintains next item ID for sequential assignment

**Testing:**
- Verified all data collections are properly stored and retrieved
- Confirmed next item ID tracking
- Validated integrity of stored collections

**Relationships:**
- Used by Database for data serialization and storage
